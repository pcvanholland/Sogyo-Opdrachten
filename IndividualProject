What I want to make is a (4-player) card-game named Tai-Pan (in Dutch). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu)
- Back-end in JAVA (why? OCA).
- Players can register:
-- Database (SQL?)
-- Save game results.
- Front-end in Vue probably (or React?).

Goals:
Techniques:
- Making front end with Vue or React.
- Different type of DB, perhaps.
- Make Jenkins deploy the server.
- Try IDE?

Personal:
- Do not take work home.
- Plan stuff.
