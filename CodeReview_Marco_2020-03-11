API and domain really ought to be separated,,,
As should the DataBase.
JSON Processor makes little sense inside the domain. The domain ought to work with classes only.
Possibility: Make functions that are generally okay to access from other classes public, to make it clear to fellow programmers that they are accessable.
Database: Make a connection per API-call, not per function.
API-Classes can be much better described and defined.
How about logging? Logging in CLI seems to be okay, but one could implement a framework.
Exceptions are communication to the outside world, thus don't catch them in the domain. Domain may be aggressive. (General TaiPanException.)

"OO" Seems properly implemented.
Flow of progam can be followed.
