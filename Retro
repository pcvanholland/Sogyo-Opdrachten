I've got some trouble with the MVP-like approach.
I do have a website, although nothing shows there yet.
There is not yet a database but a few of the card combinations are done.

I do start the day with approximately an hour of OCA, so that's good.
At first, I spent way too much time in getting static code analysis working.
Still thinking a lot about the project at home.

Therefore I'm gonna try to set up some MVP today and defer the rules to a later date.
Thus trying to develop more vertically than horizontally.

One part I really like is the CI/CD, or at least the solid testing there is in place.

I've got lots of trouble in designing one particular rule.
The MVP-like approach is improving.

Less thinking back home :)
The OCA-part has diminished, sadly, mostly due to the increased noise in the academy.

The combination of domain and API was not nice.
MVP-Like approach is flourishing :)
